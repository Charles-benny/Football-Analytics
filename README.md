# Football Analytics Project

## Overview
This project focuses on advanced football analytics, leveraging computer vision and machine learning to provide in-depth analysis and insights into football matches. The system detects and tracks players, referees, and the ball, extracting key performance metrics and presenting them through interactive dashboards.

## Features
- **Player and Object Detection**: Utilizes YOLO models to detect and classify players, referees, and the ball in real-time.
- **Keypoint Detection**: Maps key tactical points on the pitch for strategic analysis.
- **Performance Metrics**: Extracts performance metrics such as player movement, ball possession, and tactical formations.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive dashboards created with Streamlit for visualizing insights.

## Technologies Used
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV, YOLO models
- **Machine Learning**: Custom-trained models
- **Data Visualization**: Streamlit
- **Programming Languages**: Python
